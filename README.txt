 TUTORIAL FOR THE LORENZ 63 SYSTEM

######################################


A Jupyter Notebook looking at the Lorenz 63 system. 

Created for the AMS 2024 MRC on Climate Science at the Interface of Dynamical Systems Theory and Topological Data Analysis.

The Notebook looks at the Lorenz 63 system, its regime behaviour (including response to forcing), its predictability,
and dynamical systems properties (density, local dimension, persistence). Some exercises are included.

Only basic python packages are needed: numpy, scipy and matplotlib. 
To compute local dimension and persistence, I borrowed code from this public repo: 

https://github.com/FabriFalasca/climate-and-dynamical-systems

I therefore thank Fabri Falasca for making this code public. Their code in turn draws from code by Yoann Robin:

I am grateful to Yoann Robin as well.
